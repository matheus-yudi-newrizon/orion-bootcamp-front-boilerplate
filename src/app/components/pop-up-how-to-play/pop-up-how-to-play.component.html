    Review Reveal is a game where you have to guess the movie based on user reviews.
  <br>
  <br>
    When you start the game, you will be presented with a review written by a user on IMDb.
  <br>
  <br>
    Your task is to carefully read the review and, based on its content, make an informed guess about which movie it is referring to.
  <br>
  <br>
    Each correct guess earns you a new review to continue the game, you start with 2 lives, and every mistake costs you one life. <span>If you run out of lives, you lose the game.</span>
